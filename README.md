# SongBirb

## Intro

SongBirb was a Discord music bot originally created to play Pok√©mon music. As the communities the betas were released in evolved, its features did too. Therefore, SongBirb has now become a fully open-source Discord bot!

## Running

First, change the token (`logins.token`) in [`config.js`](config.js) to your bot token. Then, run `npm install` to get the dependencies. Finally, run [`index.js`](index.js) and you'll be all good to go!
